# STEPS IN LINEAR DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

-> Feature Scaling

-> Applying LDA

-> Training the Logistic Regression model on the Training set

-> Making the Confusion Matrix

-> Visualising the Training set results

-> Visualising the Test set results
